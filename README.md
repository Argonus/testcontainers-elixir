# Testcontainers

> Testcontainers is an Elixir library that supports ExUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

Current in planning phase. Feedback is appreciated.

The library will use 

https://github.com/jarlah/docker-engine-api

to communicate with docker engine api, if the library works (not yet tested, but generated for this very purpose)
