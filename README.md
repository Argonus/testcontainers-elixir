# Testcontainers

> Testcontainers is an Elixir library that supports ExUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

Current in planning phase. Feedback is appreciated.

The plan is to use Gleam for the core. Because the end goal is not to learn Elixir but to provide testcontainer facilities for all kinds Elixir projects my own included.
