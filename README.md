# Testcontainers

> Testcontainers is an Elixir library that supports ExUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

Current in planning phase. Feedback is appreciated.

The library will use 

https://github.com/jarlah/docker-engine-api-elixir

to communicate with docker engine api. The latter is an autogenerated elixir client library from openapi spec with some adjustments for proper usage.
